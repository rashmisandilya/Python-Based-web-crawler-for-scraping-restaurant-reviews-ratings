I wouldn't recommend these pizzas for sharing, unless you are ordering some other items, because of this reason (And also because it is just too good to share).

Again, everything was outstanding, the food, the service, the environment. We started with a Peruvian tamal that has been the best tamal we have ever had, very very different from the Central American tamal or from the Cuban tamal. We also had escabeche Peruvian scallops, this scallops were extraordinary! We ordered Jalea for two, Mahi-Mahi with peruvian salad and quinoa (the quinoa tasted sooo good, it had peas and carrots, like a Peruvian Chaufa but without the calories of the rice and the salad very yummy) I ordered the lomo salteado with Pacu (lomo salteado is filet mignon saut with peppers and tomatoes and Pacu is a rice mixed with a Peruvian type of beans that is soo delicious). Its impossible to go wrong with any entree here at Machu Pichu, everything is just unbelievable great. Desserts were Tiramisu, Peruvian rice pudding and flan de coco (coconut custard) I cannot choose which one was the best because they were all delicious.

A little more time on the smoker was needed as the meat was slightly undercooked. I believe this is what led to the lack of flavor other than the sauce, my nephew, slathered on top of it.
